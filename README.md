# TennisRefactoringKata

Refactor a short code sample to make it more maintainable and then add some new functionality.
1. Refactor the code in TennisGame1 to make it more maintainable.
2. Using TDD, add functionality to keep track of the number of games won.

When a game is won:
- The game points are reset to Love-All
- The number of games won increases by one for the winning player
